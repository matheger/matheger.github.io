# Welcome!

My name is Matt. I am a PhD researcher in molecular spectroscopy and quantum simulations who has recently decided to extend his career into the field of data analytics. In order to hone and showcase my analysis skills and programming capabilities, I have set up this website as a minimal, work-in-progress portfolio. 

For some example projects and code snippets, feel free to head over to the [Projects](/projects) page. 

If you are familiar with the Python programming language, you might also appreciate this relentlessly nerdy collection of nonsense.
