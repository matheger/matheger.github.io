# Welcome!

My name is Matt. I have a PhD in physical chemistry, specifically spectroscopy and quantum simulations, and have recently decided to extend my career opportunities into the field of data analytics. This page acts as a minimal, work-in-progress showcase for the latter. You can find example analysis projects and code snippets on the [Projects](/projects) page.
