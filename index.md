# Welcome!

My name is Matt. I have been working as a PhD researcher in physical chemistry (specifically spectroscopy and quantum simulations) for several years, which gives me a solid mathematical and data-centric background. I have recently decided to extend my career opportunities into the field of data analytics; this page acts as a minimal, work-in-progress showcase for my new skill set. 

For some example projects and code snippets, please see the [Projects](/projects) page.
