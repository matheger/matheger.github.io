# Welcome!

My name is Matt. I am a PhD researcher in molecular spectroscopy and quantum simulations who has recently decided to extend his career into the field of data analytics. This website works as a minimal, work-in-progress portfolio in order to hone and showcase my analysis skills and programming capabilities. 

For some example projects and code snippets, feel free to head over to the [Projects](/projects) page. 

If you are familiar with the Python programming language, you might also appreciate [this](/python) little collection of relentlessly nerdy things.
